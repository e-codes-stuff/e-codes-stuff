Hello, I'm a programmer who mainly makes tools. I experiment with concepts I find interesting, trying to learn as much as I can about computer science and mathematics.
Much of my work is private, but I upload what I can here.



### Languages I use:
- Rust (My favorite of all languages I have used)
- C#
- Lua
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python
- Go
